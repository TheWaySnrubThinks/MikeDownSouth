      comment: "Good job on taking a picture of a page that didn’t reveal how dirty your mind is. This list would actually be fantastic if I was nearly as awesome as you and able to take a year off to backpack across South America, so thank you from everyone cooler than me (and thanks for making me jealous)."

      comment: "Medellin is the worst for flakey girls and many girls have a princessy attitude when you do happen to take them out – I usually avoid Medellin and Bogota, there are muchh better pickings in other places-…And sometimes there is some kind of weird ritual in parts of colombia(barranquilla, cali) like she really likes you so she is making herself supeerr pretty for you and taking forever say and extra 45 minutes to 3 hours, no joke (right and you sitting there fuming waiting for something that seems like its not going to happen). I think I figured out a few ways to prevent this..first off make her as excited to see you as possible..we’re not negotiating contracts here you’re trying te pique her interest..flirt, joke..be mysterious, maybe don’t show up once yourself ;) hints that other people(girls) are inviting you out==all of these do wonders for increasing interest. I usually pick a place near where I am as kind of the pre meeting place or a place near a ciber so I have something else to do. Oh and if its the first time you are meeting a girl you want ZERO pressure on her..no hun were just hanging out drinking a little of colombias finest coffee-If you have a trip to the zoo a flight to cartagena planned she might feel alot of pressure and finally decide to duck out. Of course after the coffee you might suggest the zoo and then you are low pressure AND spontaneous. .. And one last thing tip that took me along time to figure out…whats the right thing to do if she flakes on you? If you get angry usually its the nail in the coffin of that relationship..So what I do is call her later and apologize for not showing up…that will alleviate her guilt for standing you up and not make you look like a loser waiting around for nothing. Then if you still want to make another date its very likely she will show up."

The eating toilet paper experiment is interesting, but I’d be afraid that if I tested it out, South America would implode from the devastating paradox."
