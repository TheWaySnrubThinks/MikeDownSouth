At my current hostel, you need to leave your key at reception whenever you leave and pick it up when you get back. It’s kind of a hassle, but it’s pretty routine at this point and I don’t much notice it. I came back to my hostel after lunch yesterday and there was a guy working reception who was probably about 20. I asked, “¿Podría tener mi llave? [Can I have my key?]” He looked a little worried and stood up and started searching around the desk. I heard him mutter to himself, “Okay… okay.” Peruvians use the word “okay” but I don’t hear it much, so I was wondering if this guy was Peruvian. He definitely looked South American. Or maybe like a tan Asian person. I’ve been surprised at how hard it is to distinguish between the two.

“Okay, you can do this,” he whispered to himself. Alright, that was *definitely* English. And he must be new because the task of getting my room key was apparently really stressing him out. I’ve been at this hostel about a week and everyone on the staff I’d met was Peruvian, so hearing him speak English threw me a bit.

“Are you speaking English?” I asked him.<br/>
“Oh, yeah. Sorry.”

Except he didn’t say “sorry.” He said “soary.” Canadian! I had to confirm.

“Are you Canadian?”<br/>
“Oh… Yeah.”<br/>
“Ah. I caught your ‘soary’.”<br/>
“Oh, um. That’s okay.”<br/>

He was still a little frazzled from my heart attack-inducing “can I have my key” request, so he misunderstood what I said. He thought I was apologizing to him for something I had done. Instead of questioning it, he decided to just roll with it and accept my apology. Definitely Canadian.

“No, I mean I could tell you were Canadian because you said ‘soary’.”<br/>
“Oh, yeah. The politeness thing. Yeah.”

No! Not the politeness thing! It’s because you talk funny, Canada. Why does this always seem to be news to you?

So I can positively identify a Canadian accent if they’re from the right area and I hear any of the giveaway words (“sorry,” “about,” etc.). But I realized that’s about it. I still can’t distinguish most other accents. I confuse New Zealand for Australia, Australia for England, England for Ireland. I can’t distinguish between a Dane and a German. All of the Eastern European accents sound pretty similar to me. Ditto for all of Scandinavia. I can’t even definitively spot another American because it could just be a sneaky Canadian that hasn’t blown his cover yet. I suppose I could identify an American with a distinctly American accent, like from the Deep South or something, but to date, I have met zero travelers from the Deep South.

The one other accent I have been able to positively identify is Argentina. It’s pretty easy because they replace a lot of “ya” sounds with “sha” sounds so it’s “pla-sha” instead of “pla-ya” (beach). They also use weird Spanish expressions that nobody else uses, like, “¿De donde sus? [Where are you from?]” whereas everyone else would say, “¿De donde eres?”

So there you have it. My secret, never before revealed techniques for identifying (some) people from *two* countries. Use your new powers responsibly.
