C’mon, Spanish workbook! It’s not like I’ve absorbed all information in the world *except* Spanish and this is the last thing I have left to learn. I don’t know where the Summer Olympics were held in ‘92 or which team won the ‘99 World Series. Or that *ET* actually *didn’t* win Best Picture (it lost to *Gandhi*, apparently). You definitely wanted me to get that one wrong, Spanish workbook.
