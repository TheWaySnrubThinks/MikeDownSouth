I was walking back to my hostel from the Arequipa city center and I suddenly noticed that almost every business on the street was a driving school. It seemed like more driving schools than you’d need for a city of only a million people and a LOT more driving schools than you’d need on a single 3 block stretch of road in *any* city. I broke out my camera and I turned on the “driving school count overlay” feature so I could get a full count of the number of schools.

Fourteen driving schools! I repeat that this is on a single 3 block stretch of road! I’ve seen this a lot in Peru. Sometimes it’s something like a bunch of candle stores or lamp stores clumped together, which makes a little more sense. Other times it’s a street with like 9 identical book stores in a row. I don’t know if there’s some sort of weird zoning laws or if one business opens and everyone else is like, “What a great business slash location! I’ll do the same.”
